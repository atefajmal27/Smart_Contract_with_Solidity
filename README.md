## Background
In this repository, I built smart contracts to automate some company finances to make everyone's lives easier, increase transparency, and to make accounting and auditing practically automatic!

## Steps
One: Create AssociateProfitSplitter contract- This will accept Ether into the contract and divide the Ether evenly among the associate level employees. This will allow the Human Resources department to pay employees quickly and efficiently.

Upon making the contract, I made an transaction with one ethereum to make sure it's working properly.

Two: Create TieredProfitSplitter contract- This will distribute different percentages of incoming Ether to employees at different tiers/levels. For example, the CEO gets paid 60%, CTO 25%, and Bob gets 15%.

Upon creating the contract, I made an transaction with one ethereum to make sure it's working properly.
